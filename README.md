# ADC-Based-Servo-Control-System
This project demonstrates how an ATmega2560 microcontroller can read an analog voltage using the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and use that data to control a servo motor through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). The servo position changes in real time based on the potentiometer input, while an LED bar displays the corresponding 8-bit ADC value.
